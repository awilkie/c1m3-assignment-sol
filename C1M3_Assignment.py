# # Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents
# 
# In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems.

# ### 🎯 Learning Objectives
# 
# By the end of this lab, you can:
# - Chain steps into a research pipeline (**search → reflection → formatting**).
# - Convert natural-language output into **styled HTML** suitable for sharing.

# <h4 style="color:green; font-weight:bold;">TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL GRADING OF YOUR ASSIGNMENT:</h4>
# 
# * All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to write your solution code or when explicitly mentioned you can interact with it.
# 
# * In each exercise cell, look for comments `### START CODE HERE ###` and `### END CODE HERE ###`. These show you where to write the solution code. **Do not add or change any code that is outside these comments**.
# 
# * You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.
# 
# * Avoid using global variables unless you absolutely have to. The grader tests your code in an isolated environment without running all cells from the top. As a result, global variables may be unavailable when scoring your submission. Global variables that are meant to be used will be defined in UPPERCASE.
# 
# * To submit your notebook for grading, first save it by clicking the 💾 icon on the top left of the page and then click on the <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 3px 5px; font-size: 16px; border-radius: 5px;">Submit assignment</span> button on the top right of the page.

# ## Using Tools
# 
# You’ll use two research tools exposed in the `research_tools` module:
# - **`arxiv_search_tool(query, max_results)`** – academic papers via arXiv API.
# - **`web_search_tool(query, max_results)`** – general web search via DuckDuckGo.

# Let's explore how the `arxiv_search_tool` works.
# 
# This tool searches arXiv and returns a list of papers with:
# - `title`, `authors`, `published`, `summary`, `url`, and (if available) `link_pdf`.
# 
# Below, we run a quick test and print the results in a readable format. Next cell is editable so feel free to try some search queries:
# 

# In[ ]:


# Test the arXiv search tool
topic = "linear algebra"

arxiv_results = research_tools.arxiv_search_tool(topic, max_results=3)

# Show formatted arxiv_results
for i, paper in enumerate(arxiv_results, 1):
    if "error" in paper:
        print(f"❌ Error: {paper['error']}")
    else:
        print(f"📄 Paper {i}")
        print(f"  Title     : {paper['title']}")
        print(f"  Authors   : {', '.join(paper['authors'])}")
        print(f"  Published : {paper['published']}")
        print(f"  URL       : {paper['url']}\n")


print("\n🧾 Raw arxiv_Results:\n")
print(json.dumps(arxiv_results, indent=2))


# The `tavily_search_tool` calls the Tavily API to fetch web results. Returns a list of dicts:
# - `title`, `content`, `url` (and optional image URLs when `include_images=True`).
# 
# Run the cell to inspect sample output. Next cell is editable so feel free to try some search queries:

# In[ ]:


# Test the web search tool
topic = "retrieval-augmented generation applications"

web_results = research_tools.web_search_tool(topic)
for item in web_results:
    print(item)


# ## Tool Mapping
# 
# In the next cell you will define a dictionary that maps tool names (strings) to the actual Python functions. This allows the model to call tools by name during tool-calling. This dictionary will be used in your first graded function:

# In[ ]:


# Tool mapping
TOOL_MAPPING = {
    "web_search_tool": research_tools.web_search_tool,
    "arxiv_search_tool": research_tools.arxiv_search_tool,
}


# ## Exercise 1: Generate Research Report with Tools
# **Goal:** Implement `generate_research_report_with_tools(prompt)`.
# In this exercise, you'll work on a function that generates a detailed research report with the assistance of online tools. Focus on setting up interaction with the language model and handling the responses effectively.
# 
# ## Key Hints
# 
# ### 1. Setting Up the Chat with the Language Model
# - **Tool Selection**: Ensure that the tools are automatically selected by the model. Look into how to set `tool_choice` to "auto" within the function call. A helpful resource can be found in [OpenAI’s Function Calling Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#tool-choice).
# - **Parameter Configuration**: Consider the parameters already defined in your function, such as model, messages, and tools. Think about how these might be used in your setup.
# 
# ### 2. Recording Tool Call Results
# - **Understanding the `ChatCompletionMessage`** object will help you access the required attributes to save the messages. An example of `ChatCompletionMessage` looks like this: 
# 
# ```python
# ChatCompletionMessage(
#     content=None,
#     refusal=None,
#     role='assistant',
#     annotations=[],
#     audio=None,
#     function_call=None,
#     tool_calls=[
#         ChatCompletionMessageFunctionToolCall(
#             id='call_ymMki5TBB91efJhMPjgoqjop',
#             function=Function(
#                 arguments='{"query":"radio observations of recurrent novae","max_results":5}',
#                 name='arxiv_search_tool'
#             ),
#             type='function'
#         )
#     ]
# )
# ```
# Assuming that `msg` if of type `ChatCompletionMessage`, if you wanted to get the `name` of a `tool_call` you can do something like:
# ```python
#  for call in msg.tool_calls:
#     tool_name = call.function.name
# ```
# Finally, the `result` variable will be created by actually calling the function associated with each tool (`tool_func`).
# 
# By leveraging these hints, you'll work towards an implementation that enables robust data gathering and report generation through smart tool integration.

# ## Exercise 2: Reflection + Rewrite
# 
# **Goal:** Implement `reflection_and_rewrite(report)`.
# 
# In this task, your goal is to develop a function that takes a report, analyzes it, generates a structured reflection, and produces an improved version of the report. This involves two main tasks: crafting a precise prompt and setting up a correctly configured response call to the language model.
# 
# ## Key Steps
# 
# ### 1. Create a User Prompt
# 
# - **Objective**: Guide the language model to output a structured response in JSON format.
# - **Format**: Ensure the output includes two keys, `"reflection"` and `"revised_report"`.
# - **Details**: Your reflection should cover strengths, limitations, suggestions, and opportunities. The revised report should incorporate these elements to improve clarity and academic tone.
# 
# ### 2. Configure the Response Call
# 
# - **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `"gpt-4o-mini"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.
# - **Structure**: Make sure the response setup directs the model properly, ensuring the JSON format is adhered to without additional commentary.
# 
# 
# By implementing these steps, your function will effectively transform and improve the given reports. Handle JSON parsing carefully to ensure the output is valid and reliable. Happy coding!

# ## Exercise 3: Convert Report to HTML
# **Goal:** Implement `convert_report_to_html(report)`.
# This exercise focuses on transforming a plain text research report into a well-structured HTML document. You will build a function to facilitate this conversion using a language model.
# 
# ## Key Steps
# 
# ### 1. Create a User Prompt
# - **Objective**: Instruct the model to transform plain text into HTML structure.
# - **Format**: Ensure the output is valid, clean HTML with appropriate section headers, formatted paragraphs, and clickable links.
# - **Details**: Preserve the citation style and request that the model responds only with HTML, without additional commentary.
# 
# ### 2. Configure the Response Call
# - **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `"gpt-4o"`) and set an appropriate temperature to balance creativity and accuracy.
# - **Structure**: Configure the `CLIENT.chat.completions.create` call properly, using both system and user prompts to ensure a clear and focused task description.
# 
# By following these steps, you'll effectively convert plaintext reports into formatted HTML documents.

# ### 🚀 End-to-End Pipeline
# 
# Run this cell to execute the full workflow:
# 
# 1. Generate a research report (tools).
# 2. Reflect on the report.
# 3. Convert the report to HTML.
# 
# > You should see the rendered HTML below and two concise reflections in the console.

# 4) Display full HTML
display(HTML(html))


# ### 📌 “Expected Output” note (for the notebook text cell)
# 
# - `generate_research_report_with_tools` should return a **non-trivial string** (> 50 chars).
# 
# - `reflection_and_rewrite` should return a **dict** with **'reflection'** and **'revised\_report'** (both strings). The reflection should **mention** the four sections (Strengths, Limitations, Suggestions, Opportunities).
# 
# - `convert_report_to_html` should return a **string that looks like HTML** (e.g., includes `<html>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, or closing tags).
# 

# ---
# 
# ## ✅ Wrap-Up
# 
# You built a mini research agent that can:
# - 🔎 call tools (arXiv + Web Search),
# - 🧠 reflect on its own output,
# - 📰 publish a clean HTML report.
# 
# Great job!
# 
# ### What to Submit
# - Your notebook with Exercise 1–3 completed.
# 
# ### Troubleshooting (quick)
# - **Model/tool-call loop stalls?** Lower `max_turns` or print intermediate messages.
# - **HTML looks odd?** Re-run conversion with a fresh assistant response.
# 
# **You’re done—nice work!** 🚀
